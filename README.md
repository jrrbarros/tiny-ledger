# README

This application shows how we can develop a simple web application
to perform some ledger operations.

## Some assumptions
- We expect to have multiple accounts in the system and even save every transaction in the DB. For now we store using the Ruby standard structures.

Requisites
- Ruby 3.4.4 must be installed.

Base installation
Rbenv must be installed. You can use your OS package manager (eg. Mac OS ```brew```).

## How to run the application
```bash
/bin/run
```

This script will handle dependencies, migrations and the startup procedure on any environment
